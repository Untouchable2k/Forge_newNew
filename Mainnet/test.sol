// ForgeTH - Contract
//
// Distrubtion of ArbiForge Token is as follows:
// 15% of Forge Token is Auctioned in the ForgeAuctions Contract which distributes tokens to users who use Ethereum to buy tokens in fair price. Each auction lasts ~3 days. Using the Auctions contract
// +
// 57% of Forge Token is distributed as Liquidiy Pool rewards in the ForgeRewards Contract which distributes tokens to users who deposit the Liquidity Pool tokens into the LPRewards contract.
// +
// 29% of Forge Token is distributed using Forge Contract(this Contract) which distributes tokens to users by using Proof of work. Computers solve a complicated problem to gain tokens!
//
// = 100% Of the Token is distributed to the users! No dev fee or premine!
//
	
// Symbol: Fge
// Decimals: 18 
//
// Total supply: 73,500,001.000000000000000000
//   =
// 21,000,000 Mined over 100+ years using Bitcoins Distrubtion halvings every 4 years @ 360 min solves. Uses Proof-oF-Work to distribute the tokens. Public Miner is available.  Uses this contract.
//   +
// 10,500,000 Auctioned over 100+ years into 4 day auctions split fairly among all buyers. ALL Ethereum proceeds go into THIS contract which it fairly distributes to miners and stakers.  Uses the ForgeAuctions contract
//   +
// 42,000,000 tokens goes to Liquidity Providers of the token over 100+ year using Bitcoin distribution!  Helps prevent LP losses!  Uses the ForgeRewards Contract
//
//  =
//
// 73,501,001 Tokens is the max Supply
//      
// 50% of the Ethereum from this contract goes to the Miner to pay for the transaction cost and if the token grows enough earn Ethereum per mint!
// 50% of the Ethereum from this contract goes to the Liquidity Providers via ForgeRewards Contract.  Helps prevent Impermant Loss! Larger Liquidity!
//
// No premine, dev cut, or advantage taken at launch. Public miner available at launch.  100% of the token is given away fairly over 100+ years using Bitcoins model!
//
// Send this contract any ERC20 token and it will become instantly mineable and able to distribute using proof-of-work!
// Donate using this contracts functions any ERC20 token and the largest donator per token is able to take control of the distribution length via our donation functions

// Donate this contract any NFT and we will also distribute it via Proof of Work to our miners!  
// Control the length using the donation functions!  Largest donation per NFT collection controls the distribution!
//   
// Same with NFTs
//* 1 tokens are burned to create the LP pool.
